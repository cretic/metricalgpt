      "\n",
      "*   **Trochee:**  Following the spondee, the two-syllable words, \"sails\" and \"snap\" act as trochees, where the stressed syllable is followed by an unstressed syllable. \n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Overall Effect:** The variation in rhythm (the spondee, then trochees) breaks up the predictable da-DUM pattern of iambic pentameter, creating a more dynamic, realistic, and engaging sound. It also reflects the suddenness of the sails snapping, making the moment feel more dramatic and immediate. The end returns the iambic flow of the words \"and fall.\"\n",
